# Advent of Code 2021

Being on the east coast while having a healthy sleep schedule means I don't get to start working on the day's puzzles until 7-8 hours after they're released. Since I can't compete with my friends by being quick, I can only hope to write clean, optimized, and well typed code that makes me happy, and keep that up until the 25th. Your days are numbered, Claus.
